The present study aims to analyze two identical scenarios using two primitive data types (float and double), in an optical network architecture in conjunction with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) heuristic algorithm. Initially the system (algorithm and network) was implemented in high level language using the Matlab development platform, and after the program was tested, the system was migrated to a low level language (C programming language). It was then opportune to generate graphs of the results obtained in both scenarios analyzed. The evolution of the algorithm in occurs with similar rates of convergence in both scenarios.
