Undergraduate research project,
Project: Proposal of Allocation and Applied Resource Control Algorithms in Optical Communications Networks Considering Network Monitoring.
In this work, the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) was investigated to solve the problem of resource allocation in PONs. Two scenarios were developed with different types of data, and the amount of physical memory required for a microcontroller was analyzed.
